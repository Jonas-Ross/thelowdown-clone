### Introduction
Hi there!
I ran across the site [The Lowdown](https://www.the-lowdown.com/underground-tokyo/) and absolutely loved the design.
I wanted to recreate it using SvelteKit.
This is my first time using SvelteKit in a personal projectf, so I'm excited to see how it goes.
All the images and text are from the original site, so all credits go to the original creators.
I'm just using it for educational purposes.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
